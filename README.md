# Graphical_Interface_Calculator
Development of a calculator with a graphical interface.

Python uses the Tkinter library, which allows to create graphical user interfaces (GUI). Help documentation for developing this project can be found [Tkinter Documentation](https://docs.python.org/3/library/tk.html). This library provides a robust and independent set of windowing tools, the main virtues of Tkinter are that it is fast.
